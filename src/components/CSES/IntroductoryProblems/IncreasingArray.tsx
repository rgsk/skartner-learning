            You are given an array of $n$ integers. You want to modify the array
            so that it is increasing, i.e., every element is at least as large
            as the previous element.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            On each move, you may increase the value of any element by one. What
            is the minimum number of moves required?

            Then, the second line contains $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$:
            the contents of the array.

          <Paragraph>
            The code ensures the array becomes non-decreasing by iterating
            through it and increasing any element smaller than the previous one.
            For each such case, it adds the difference to a counter (ops) and
            updates the element to match the previous value. The total number of
            increments (ops) is then printed as the minimum required moves.
