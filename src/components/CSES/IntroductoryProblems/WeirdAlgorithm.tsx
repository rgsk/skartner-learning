            Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n
            is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the
            algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats
            this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as
            follows:

          <Paragraph
            text={String.raw`

            `}

          <Paragraph>
            Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given
            value of n.
