          <Paragraph>
            This program uses a two-pointer technique. It sorts all arrival and
            leaving times, then iterates through them to track how many
            customers are currently in the restaurant. Each time someone
            arrives, it increments the count; each time someone leaves, it
            decrements it. The program keeps track of the maximum number of
            customers present at any moment and prints that value as the result.
