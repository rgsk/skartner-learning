          <Paragraph>
            Given an <InlineCode>n*m</InlineCode> matrix which is sorted
            row-wise, you need to find the median of the matrix.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Median of a group of numbers is the middle element after they are
            sorted. Both n and m are guaranteed to be odd numbers, therefore
            thereâ€™s only one middle number.

          <Paragraph>
            The simple approach is to store all elements in an array, sort the
            array and return the middle element of the array(i.e.{" "}
            <InlineCode>[(r*c)/2]th element</InlineCode>).

          <Paragraph>
            By the use of the binary search algorithm, this problem can be
            solved much efficiently. Since there will be exactly (r * c)/2
            numbers less than the median so we will find the [(r * c)/2 +1]th
            number.
