          <Paragraph>
            This function finds the intersection point of two linked lists using
            two pointers. Each pointer traverses its own list, and when it
            reaches the end, it switches to the other list's head. If the lists
            intersect, the pointers meet at the intersection node; otherwise,
            both become NULL.
